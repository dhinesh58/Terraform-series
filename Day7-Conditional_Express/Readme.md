**Conditional Express**

In Terraform, conditional expressions are very useful when you want to make decisions based on certain conditions.

*Syntax:*

condition ? true_value : false_value

**condition** is an expression that returns a boolean (true or false).

**true_value** is the result if the condition is true.

**false_value** is the result if the condition is false.
